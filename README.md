Create high-quality, exam-focused notes from the entire set of slides and any included tutorials I just uploaded or provided.

Requirements:
- Use ONLY the slides and tutorials I gave you as the source material – do not add external knowledge or assumptions.
- Do NOT go slide-by-slide or write "Slide 1:", "Slide 2:" etc. Instead, produce one single, logical, flowing set of notes with proper structure.
- Organize by topics/sections in a logical order (exactly like a textbook chapter or perfect revision notes), not the original slide order if it's not optimal.
- Explain EVERYTHING in simple, easy-to-understand language while keeping all original technical terms, definitions, formulas, and keywords exactly as in the slides and tutorials (crucial for exams). Do not miss ANYTHING from the slides or tutorials – include every concept, detail, example, diagram explanation, step, or point present.
- Before introducing any new topic, concept, or section, start with a brief introductory paragraph explaining what it is, what it does, and why it's important (keep this concise, 2-4 sentences max).
- Be concise but complete: cut all fluff and repetition, but ensure every single piece of information from the slides and tutorials is covered without omission.
- Use clear hierarchy:
  → Main section titles (bold or bigger)
  → Subsections
  → Bullet points or numbered when needed
  → Tables for comparisons if present
  → Highlight/key box for definitions, formulas, theorems, or anything typically asked in exams
- Add brief connections between topics when it helps understanding (e.g., "this builds on the previous section because...").
- Fully include all tutorial questions and their answers/explanations, integrated logically into the relevant sections (e.g., under a subsection like "Tutorial Examples and Solutions").
- At the end, add a short "Key Takeaways / Most Important Points for Exam" section summarizing the absolute must-know points, definitions, formulas, and tutorial highlights.

Make these the best possible revision notes I can directly use for my exam – clear, structured, concise, complete, logical, and exhaustive of the provided materials.
